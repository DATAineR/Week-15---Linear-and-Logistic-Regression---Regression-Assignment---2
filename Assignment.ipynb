    "R-squared is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of variation in the dependent variable (the variable being predicted) that is explained by the independent variables (the variables used to make predictions) in a linear regression model. In other words, it indicates how well the model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated as the ratio of the sum of squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable to the sum of squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable. Mathematically, it can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared = 1 - (SSres/SStot)\n",

    "where SSres is the sum of squared residuals (the difference between predicted values and actual values) and SStot is the total sum of squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",

    "R-squared can range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit of the model to the data. An R-squared value of 1 indicates that all of the variation in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables in the model, while an R-squared value of 0 indicates that the model does not explain any of the variation in the dependent variable.\n",

Other factors, such as multicollinearity, omitted variables, or outliers, can also affect the accuracy and validity of the model."

    " Regression analysis is a statistical technique that aims to estimate the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. To evaluate the performance of a regression model, it is common to use metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). Each of these metrics has its own advantages and disadvantages, which we will discuss below:\n",
    "\n",
    " Advantages of RMSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* RMSE is a popular evaluation metric because it has a clear interpretation in the same units as the dependent variable. This means that it is easy to understand the magnitude of the error in the context of the problem being solved.\n",
    "* RMSE gives more weight to large errors than small errors because it involves taking the square root of the mean of the squared errors. This can be useful if we want to penalize larger errors more heavily.\n",
    "* RMSE is differentiable, which means it can be used in optimization algorithms to tune the parameters of a regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    " Disadvantages of RMSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* RMSE can be sensitive to outliers because it involves taking the square root of the mean of the squared errors. This means that a single large error can have a significant impact on the metric.\n",
    "* RMSE does not have a lower bound because it can take any non-negative value. This means that it can be difficult to interpret the absolute goodness of fit of a model based on RMSE alone.\n",
    "\n",
    " Advantages of MSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MSE is a well-known metric that is widely used in many areas of statistics.\n",
    "* MSE is sensitive to both the magnitude and direction of errors, which can be useful in many situations.\n",
    "* MSE is relatively easy to calculate.\n",
    "\n",
    " Disadvantages of MSE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MSE puts more weight on larger errors, which can make it less interpretable in situations where the magnitude of the error is important.\n",
    "* MSE is sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    " Advantages of MAE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MAE is less sensitive to outliers than RMSE and MSE.\n",
    "* MAE is easier to interpret than RMSE and MSE because it is based on absolute errors.\n",
    "\n",
    " Disadvantages of MAE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* MAE does not take into account the direction of errors, which can be a limitation in situations where the sign of the error is important.\n",
    "* MAE puts equal weight on all errors, which can make it less useful in situations where large errors are more important than small errors.\n",
    "\n",
    " Overall, the choice of which metric to use for evaluating regression models depends on the specific context of the problem being studied. For example, if the consequences of large errors are significant, then RMSE may be the best metric to use. If the data contains outliers, then MAE may be more appropriate. It is important to consider the advantages and disadvantages of each metric when selecting an appropriate evaluation metric."

We have a training set of 1000 houses, and we want to build a model that can accurately predict the sale price of new houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without regularization, we might train a linear regression model that fits the training set very closely, with a high coefficient assigned to each feature. However, this model is likely to overfit to the training set, meaning it will perform poorly on new data that it has not seen before.\n",

This can be problematic in applications where rare or important features are critical to the prediction task.\n",
